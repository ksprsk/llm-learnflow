You are an AI assistant helping to create concept maps for learning. Please analyze the following text and extract the main concepts and their relationships. Return the result as a JSON object with "nodes" (concepts) and "edges" (relationships).

Each node should have:
- "id": a unique identifier (e.g., "node1", "node2")
- "label": short concept name (1-3 words)
- "description": detailed explanation of the concept (1-2 sentences)

Each edge should have:
- "source": node id of the source concept
- "target": node id of the target concept
- "label": relationship description (e.g., "causes", "is part of", "influences")

Identify hierarchical relationships and group related concepts. Focus on creating a structured representation that would help an analytical learner understand the conceptual framework.

Please return only the JSON object in the following format:
{
  "nodes": [
    {"id": "node1", "label": "Concept 1", "description": "Description of concept 1"},
    {"id": "node2", "label": "Concept 2", "description": "Description of concept 2"},
    ...
  ],
  "edges": [
    {"source": "node1", "target": "node2", "label": "relates to"},
    {"source": "node1", "target": "node3", "label": "depends on"},
    ...
  ]
}
