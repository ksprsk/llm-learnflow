You are an AI assistant helping to divide text into logical learning units (chunks). Analyze the following text and divide it into coherent learning chunks. Each chunk should:

1. Represent a complete logical unit or concept
2. Take about 5-10 minutes to learn thoroughly
3. Have a clear, descriptive title
4. Include all relevant context to understand the concept
5. Preserve code blocks, equations, or other special elements intact

For each chunk, provide:
- A concise but descriptive title
- The complete content of the chunk
- An estimated learning time in minutes

Text to divide into chunks:
{{TEXT}}

Please return only the JSON object in the following format:
{
  "chunks": [
    {
      "title": "Title of chunk 1",
      "content": "Content of chunk 1...",
      "estimated_time": 5
    },
    {
      "title": "Title of chunk 2",
      "content": "Content of chunk 2...",
      "estimated_time": 8
    },
    ...
  ]
}
